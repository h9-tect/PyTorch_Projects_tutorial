# PyTorch tutorial 

## in this repo I tried to explain how to use PyTorch from Zero to hero 

### in first one I tried to use tensors in PyTorch [here](https://github.com/h9-tect/PyTorch_Projects_tutorial/blob/main/PyTorch_Tensors.ipynb)
### 2nd Itried to make NN model and train it [here](https://github.com/h9-tect/PyTorch_Projects_tutorial/blob/main/how%20to%20create%20simple%20nn%20model%20by%20PyTorch.ipynb)
